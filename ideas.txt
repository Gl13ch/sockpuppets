TO RUN LUA ON GITBASH: winpty lua test.lua

--REPAIRING CLOTHING IS BASED ON IF GIVEN FABRIC:TYPE....in theory should be done automatically.

If do this way...At what point does sock puppets personality change,
character development but sock puppet.

Too complicated but just writing things...

PERSONALITY IDEAS----------------------------------------------------
upgradeable?
make base sock puppet able to add on to later which can come with side effects aka personality.

personality could also be linked to if give an item to sock puppet...
matches lighter - pyro
dead fish - stinkyGrenkk
knife - kooky

IF can give item to sock puppet does it just put it back into your inventory....could only trigger dialogue 

EX. gives camera -> triggers dialogue -> camera back in inventory

Can give sadge puppet antiDepressants/Tissues = just waste supplies

Oven Mitt - off brand sock puppet

RECIPE IDEAS---------------------------------------------------------
ex.
recipe is just turn sock into sock puppet
next find new item to add to it like pen add eyes

item can then be linked to personality?
I wonder if patches can make buff sock puppet
leather strips/denim strips/ripped rags can be made into hair or mustache
